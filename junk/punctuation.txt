not right spacing:
	Initial_Punctuation
	Open_Punctuation
	Dash_Punctuation
	White_Space

Connector_Punctuation	ligature marks

Dash_Punctuation	includes CJK dashes

Other_Punctuation

Initial_Punctuation	includes non-CJK open quotes
Final_Punctuation

Open_Punctuation	includes CJK and fullwidth brackets and quotes with distinct forms (but not fullwidth angle brackets or quotes for obvious reasons - but not non-CJK open quotes for unknown reasons)
Close_Punctuation

Space_Separator		proper white space characters (except for some really obscure stuff)
White_Space		pretty similar to Space_Separator but with some extra control chars

This still doesn't help me with:
- commas (only in Punctuation and Other_Punctuation)
- full-stops (same)
- fullwidth forms (spread all over the place, and in InHalfwidth_and_Fullwidth_Forms)
- interpuncts (only in Punctuation and Other_Punctuation)
- colons
- semicolons
